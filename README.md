## Abstract
Word clouds and text visualization is one of the recent most popular and widely used types of visualizations. Despite the attractiveness and simplicity of producing word clouds, they do not provide a thorough visualization for the distribution of the underlying data. Therefore, it is important to redesign word clouds for improving the design choices and to be able to do further statistical analysis on data. In this paper we have proposed the development of a fully automatic redesigning algorithm for word cloud visualization. Our proposed method is able to decode an input word cloud visualization and provides the raw data in the form of a list of (word, value) pairs. We have tested our proposed method both qualitatively and quantitatively. The results of our experiments show that our algorithm is able to extract the words and their weights effectively with considerable low error rate.

## Running Instructions

Put your running instructions here.  (Tell us how to open your visualization.) 

If your visualization is web-based,  it would be great if your submissions can be opened online. [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) is a good and easy way to put your visualization online so you can put your link here.  For example:

Access our visualization at http://cse512-14w.github.io/fp-jheer-kanitw/ or download this repository and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000` and access this from http://localhost:9000/.

(If you put your work online, please also write [one-line description and put a link to your final work](http://note.io/1n3u46s) so people can access it directly from CSE512-14W page.)
